% ACTUAL SEMINAR STUFF
\section{Preface}

This is the written report corresponding to my talk in the seminar 
\emph{Selected topics in Mathematical Physics: Quantum information theory}. The 
seminar was lead by Prof. Dr. Manfred Salmhofer, executive director of the 
Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Heidelberg, and Dr. 
Markus M\"uller, junior research group leader at that institute. 

The talk starts with a review of some properties of pure quantum states, 
unitary matrices and density matrices, followed by the introduction of group 
representations and the Haar measure. The final result will be the proof of 
Schur's Lemma and its use for calculating expectation values of random pure 
states.

\section{Motivation}

In fields like statistical dynamics or chaos theory, we use probabilistic 
models to come to conclusions about the state and the evolution of a system. 
If we want to apply quantum theory to these fields, it would be helpful to 
know whether a state whose classical analog is chaotic is effectively random 
\cite{wootters}. 

For the definition of a \emph{random quantum state} we need at least a 
probability measure on the set of quantum states. It turns out that the 
\emph{Haar measure} can be seen as a probability measure, and that 
some results of group representation theory allow us to calculate some results 
for random quantum states. 

In this seminar talk, we will start with some basics on the unitary group, then 
we will introduce the Haar measure as a probability measure on the unitary 
group, and we will close with the calculation of expectation values of random 
pure states:
\begin{equation}
\E(\ket{\psi}) = \int_{\ugroup{n}} \ket{\psi}\Id |\psi\rangle.
\end{equation}

\section{The Unitary Group}
Basics...

\section{The Haar Integral}

\begin{definition}\label{def:integral} (positive integral)\\
 An integral $\mu$ is a linear functional from the space 
 \begin{equation*}
 \Cont_+(G) = \Set{f: G\to\R| f(g)\geq 0, g\text{ continuous}} 
 \end{equation*}
 to the non-negative real numbers. The 
integral is called \emph{positive}, if for all $f$ with compact support 
$\mu(f)>0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation} (integral notation)\\
  If $\mu$ is an integral, we write
  \begin{equation}
   \mu(f) =: \int\limits_G f(x)\Id\mu(x)
  \end{equation}
  for a continuous non-negative function $f$ like in definition 
  \ref{def:integral}. 
  
  Sometimes we also want to refer to \emph{volumes} of subsets of $G$. We abuse 
the notation and define the measure $\mu$ associated with this integral as 
  \begin{equation}
   \mu(A) := \int\limits_G \chi_A(x)\Id\mu(x)
  \end{equation}
  for a borel set $A\subseteq G$ and the \emph{characteristic function} $\chi$.
\end{notation}

\begin{thm} (Haar, see \cite{haar})
 On every locally compact group $G$ exists at least one 
\end{thm}



\section{Unitary Group Representations}
\begin{prop}(compare to \cite{rep}, p.68) \label{thm:directsum}\\
 Let $\urep{g}$ be a group representation of the group $G$ on the $G$-module 
$V$.  
\begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
 \item If $V_1\subset V$ is a $G$-submodule, then there is a $G$-submodule 
  $V_2\perp V_1$ with $V = V_1 \oplus V_2$. 
\item The $G$-module $V$ is the direct sum of irreducible, pairwise orthogonal 
  $G$-submodules.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Let $V_1$ be a $G$-submodule of $V$. If $V_1 = V$ or $V_1 = \{0\}$, the 
proposition (a) is trivial. Let therefore $m\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ be the 
dimension of $V_1$. We can choose an orthonormal base $\ket{u_i}, 1\leq i\leq m$ 
of $V_1$ and extend it to an orthonormal base $\ket{u_i}, 1\leq i\leq n$ of $V$. 
Now we observe the group action on these base vectors. For an arbitrary, but 
fixed $g\in G$, we write 
\begin{equation}
 \urep{g} = \summe{i}{1}{n}\summe{j}{1}{n} a_{ij} \ket{u_i}\bra{u_j}.
\end{equation}
The group action on $\ket{u_k}, 1\leq i\leq m$ is therefore
\begin{equation}
 \urep{g}\ket{u_k} = \summe{i}{1}{n}\summe{j}{1}{n} a_{ij} 
\ket{u_i}\braket{u_j|u_k} = \summe{i}{1}{n} a_{ik}\ket{u_i}.
\end{equation}
This vector must lie in $\mathrm{span}(\{\ket{u_k}, 1\leq k\leq m\})$, and thus 
$\forall 1\leq k\leq m, m<i\leq n: a_{ik} = 0$. We can apply the same argument 
to the representation $\urep{g^{-1}} = \urep{g}^\dagger$, and find that 
$\forall 1\leq k\leq m, m<i\leq n: a_{ki} = 0$. We can now write 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:repsum}
 \urep{g} = \left(\summe{i}{1}{m}\summe{j}{1}{m} a_{ij} 
\ket{u_i}\bra{u_j}\right) + \left(\summe{i}{m+1}{n}\summe{j}{m+1}{n} a_{ij} 
\ket{u_i}\bra{u_j}\right),
\end{equation}
which shows us that $V_2$ is also invariant under the group action, and 
therefore a $G$-submodule of $V$.

The second part of the proposition is easily shown by induction: apply 
the arguments given here on the $G$-submodules $V_1$ and $V_2$ recursively.
\end{proof}

This proposition also provides us with some insight about the structure of 
reducible group representations. As we can see in equation \ref{eq:repsum}, all 
the representation matrices are in fact block diagonal matrices with respect to 
the chosen orthonormal base, and therefore to any orthonormal base constructed 
from bases of the irreducible submodules.


\section{Schur's Lemma}
In most of the literature  available, Schur's lemma is stated in terms of 
morphisms between $G$-modules, but we will use a less general version in 
terms of matrices, because it is sufficient for the calculation of the 
properties that we are interested in. 
\begin{thm}(Schur's Lemma for unitary representations)\\
 Let
 \begin{align*}
  r: G&\to \ugroup{n}\\
  g&\mapsto \urep{g}
 \end{align*}
 be an irreducible unitary 
 representation of the group $G$ on the complex vector space $V$. If an 
endomorphism $A$ on $V$ commutes with  $\urep{g}$ 
 for all $g\in G$, then A is a scalar matrix, i.e. 
 \begin{equation}
  A = \lambda \ind_n,\ \lambda\in\C.
 \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 We can state the commutativity of A as 
 \begin{equation*}
  A\urep{g} = \urep{g}A\quad \forall g\in G.
 \end{equation*}
 Let $\ket{v}\in\C^n\setminus\{0\}$ be  
an eigenvector of A and $\lambda\in\C$ be an eigenvalue to this eigenvector, 
i.e. $A\ket{v} = \lambda\ket{v}$. 
Then 
 \begin{equation*}
  A\urep{g}\ket{v} = \urep{g}A\ket{v} = \lambda\urep{g}\ket{v},
 \end{equation*}
 and thus $\urep{g}\ket{v}$ is as well an eigenvector to the eigenvalue 
 $\lambda$. This holds for all $\urep{g}$, and therefore the eigenspace 
 $S_\lambda = \left\{\ket{v}\in v: A\ket{v} = \lambda\ket{v} \right\}$ is 
 an invariant subspace under the unitary representation $r$. The representation 
 is irreducible, so either $S_\lambda = \{0\}$ 
 or $S_\lambda = V$ holds by definition. Since $0\neq\ket{v}\in S_\lambda$, 
we get 
$S_\lambda  = V$. This means that $\lambda$ is the only eigenvalue of $A$, 
and we can  write for some orthonormal base $\left\{\ket{u_i}, 1\leq i\leq 
n\right\}$ of $\C^n$:
 \begin{equation*}
  A = \summe{i}{1}{n} \lambda \ket{u_i} \bra{u_i} = \lambda\ind_n
 \end{equation*}






\end{proof}
